These Snap tools are a set of simple web scrapers intended to get patch notes from the Marvel snap website or card stats from snap.fan

SnapCard.py grabs a card from snap.fan
SnapOTA-MainPage.py requests the page for the latest ota or patch notes, parses and outputs the page to a text file for easy formatting into a reddit post.  
SnapOTA is similar to the main page except it requires the cloudfront URL and retrieves the full body and prases that for the notes, same output as above.
